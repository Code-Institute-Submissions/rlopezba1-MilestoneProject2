## UX 

### Game Objective

- This game is for anyone who wants to entertain himself and have a good time. In particular, Star Wars lovers will enjoy 
        this game as it will remind them the saga they love so much.

- The game is presented without too many preambles, directly to start playing. 
    The first thing every user sees are the cards with the image of Star Wars, as is the theme of the game.

- Most people know how to play this game, but just in case, in the upper left corner, it is specified that it is a Star Wars memory game.

- On its left side, we find the first button, which when clicked, explains the way to play and the objective of the game, which can help those who do not know how to play.

- The next button allows us to change the background of the game to go deeper into the galactic atmosphere, or to return to the traditional blue sky background.

- The next two buttons allow us to activate and deactivate the music, which allows us to create a greater atmosphere of Star Wars.

- Next we can find a Timer that tell us how many seconds are we playing 

- The next button allow us to pause and start the Timer and the game.

- The next button allows us to start and finish the game again.

### User Objective

- Play a game that is fun, dynamic, entertaining, for all types of users, that is not difficult to play or understand.

- Allows me to change and the interact (background, music, ...), I can do something else that just play the game to make it a grateful experience.

- It has to be exciting, and we getting this with the time bar telling us the time left.

### Project goals
- Create a fun, dynamic and entertaining game for the user
- Create a relaxed image, a quickly access to the game and be able to interact easily.

### User stories

1. As a site visitor, I want to start playing as soon as possible.
2. As a site visitor, I want to learn how to play.
3. As a site visitor, I want to see how much time I have left to finish the game.
4. As a site visitor, I want to put music and change the background.

### Design
- Strategy Plane My strategy for this game was to offer a fun gaming experience that allows the player to practice their memory skills. 
    It is based on the Star Wars saga, so that those fans of the saga can enjoy it even more.

- Scope plane The main feature was going to be the memory game itself along with some other features, such as the possibility of giving a darker background, 
a timer, optional sound effects, which allows to be relaxed or to recreate the atmosphere of the movie.

- Structure plan When the key features were established, the structure plan was quite simple. I was going to have a single full-featured page and get a good balance.

    - Colors:
        - A palette of few colors to try to give an elegant and relaxed image, where each color complements each other.
        - Color palette - Few main colors complement the design of the site. These are shown below: 
        - <span style="color: #1c7ccc">#1c7ccc It's the background color for the cards</span>
        - <span style="color: #007bff">#007bff It's info button color</span>
        - <span style="color: #28a745">#28a745 It's dark/light button color</span>
        - <span style="color: #ffc107">#ffc107 It's the restart button color</span>
        - <span style="color: #f8f9fa">#f8f9fa It's the music button color</span>  

    - Typography:
        - I have used the Girassol font because it is very similar to the Star Wars font.

## Changes I made throuought the project

- Initially, I wanted the information to appear right next to the game but I realized that in smaller devices, the cards were very small.
- So I opted to place all the options in a navigation bar so that small devices can play perfectly as the navigation bar collapses, and it is up to the user to see them or not.
    
## Features
### Design Features

- I want the website to be original, fun, easy to use.
  
- The webpage has a simple structure to facilitate its function. At the top is a fixed response navigation bar with buttons that will give the user different 
options to background and to know the operation of the game, as well as to start the game again.

- The user experience should be easy to navigate and have a good time.

- The web will be elegant and fun at the same time. The navigation bar will collapse on mobile devices and be justified centrally on the page.

- Research has been carried out on other Internet pages, but this design, with these colors, images, structure, and fonts,
   it is completely original.

### Skeleleton
- [Wireframe in Design](./assets/wireframes/milestoneProject2.pdf) 
   using Balsamiq in large, medium and small devices sizes.
   
- Responsive Design
    - I have changed the initial design, as I think it is important to give the maximum importance to the game, and therefore the cards should be as large as possible 
    on the smallest devices.
    - The information of the game, the change of theme, or the activation of the music are secondary, so on small devices, they are hidden and it is up to the user if they want to use them or not.

## Issues and Bugs
The text on the main page did not look good on some devices. 
- I had to change the margin and heights for these devices.
- I had some problems with combination of CSS and Bootstrap structure.
- I had some problems with the cards on the small size screen. I solved it by changing the margins and heights.

All of these problems have taken me a long time but I have enjoyed solving them.
