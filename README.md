## UX Strategy

- Game Objective

    - This game is for anyone who wants to entertain himself and have a good time. In particular, Star Wars lovers will enjoy 
        this game as it will remind them the saga they love so much.

    - The game is presented without too many preambles, directly to start playing. 
    The first thing every user sees are the cards with the image of Star Wars, as is the theme of the game.

    - Most people know how to play this game, but just in case, in the upper left corner, it is specified that it is a star wars memory game.

    - On its left side, we find the first button, which when clicked, explains the way to play and the objective of the game, which can help those who do not know how to play.

    - The next button allows us to change the background of the game to go deeper into the galactic atmosphere, or to return to the traditional blue sky background.

    - The next button allows us to start the game again.

    - The next two buttons allow us to activate and deactivate the music, which allows us to create a greater atmosphere of Star Wars.

- User Objective

    - Play a game that is fun, dynamic, entertaining, for all types of users, that is not difficult to play or understand.

    - Allows me to change and the interact(background, music, ...).

    - It has to be exciting, and we getting this with the time bar telling us the time left.

- Project goals
    - Create a fun, dynamic and entertaining game for the user
    - Create a relaxed image, quickly access the game and be able to interact easily.

- User stories

    1. As a site visitor, I want to start playing as soon as possible.
    2. As a site visitor, I want to learn how to play.
    3. As a site visitor, I want to see how long I have left to finish
    4. As a site visitor, I want to put music and change the background
    
## Features

- I want the website to be original, fun, easy to use.
  
- The webpage has a simple structure to facilitate its function. At the top is a fixed response navigation bar with buttons that will give the user different options to modify the image and to know the operation of the game, as well as to start the game again.

- The user experience should be easy to navigate and have a good time.

- The web will be elegant and fun at the same time. The navigation bar will collapse on mobile devices and be justified centrally on the page.

- Research has been carried out on other Internet pages, but this design, with these colors, images, structure, and fonts,
   it is completely original.


## Skeleleton
- [Wireframe in Design](https://github.com/rlopezba1/MilestoneProject1/blob/main/NewProject1.pdf) 
   using Balsamiq in large, medium and small devices sizes.
   
- Responsive Design
    - I have changed the initial design, as I think it is important to give the maximum importance to the game, and therefore the cards should be as large as possible 
    on the smallest devices. The information of the game, 
    the change of theme, or the activation of the music are secondary, so on small devices, they are hidden and it is up to the user if they want to use them or not.

## Design

- Colors:
    A palette of three colors to try to give an elegant and relaxed image, where each color complements each other.
    Color palette - Three main colors complement the design of the site. These are shown below: 
    - <span style="color: #1c7ccc">#1c7ccc It's the background color for the cards</span>
    - <span style="color: #007bff">#007bff It's info button color</span>
    - <span style="color: #28a745">#28a745 It's dark/light button color</span>
    - <span style="color: #ffc107">#ffc107 It's the restart button color</span>
    - <span style="color: #f8f9fa">#f8f9fa It's the music button color</span>

-	W3C CSS Validator
-   Freeformatter

### Testing Features
- A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
- The navbar was tested to collapse at the correct breakpoint.
- The form and the modal were both tested for validation of inputted data and that the user is forwarded 
to the response page once submitted.
- All buttons and nav links were checked for correct forwarding address.
### Testing Responsive action
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.


### Testing Different browsers

- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera and Safari browsers.

### Issues Found
The text on the main page did not look good on some devices. 
- I had to change the margin and heights for these devices.
- I had some problems with combination of CSS and Bootstrap structure.
- I had some problems with the cards on the small size screen. I solved it by changing the margins and heights.

All of these problems have taken me a long time but I have enjoyed solving them.
